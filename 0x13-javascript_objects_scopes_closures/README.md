Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I'll have a deeper understanding of the following concepts, enabling me to explain them without relying on external resources:

Appreciating the allure of JavaScript programming.
Crafting objects in JavaScript and understanding the implications of this and undefined.
Recognizing the importance of variable types and scopes.
Mastering closures and prototypes.
Exploring inheritance and object manipulation.
Project Tasks Overview
Rectangle #0
I'll implement an empty class Rectangle using the class notation.
Rectangle #1
I'll define a Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
Rectangle #2
I'll enhance the Rectangle class to handle invalid dimensions gracefully.
Rectangle #3
I'll add a method to print the rectangle using the character X.
Rectangle #4
I'll augment the Rectangle class with methods for rotation and dimension doubling.
Square #0
I'll introduce a Square class inheriting from Rectangle.
Square #1
I'll extend the Square class to include a method for custom character printing.
Occurrences
I'll create a function to count occurrences in a list.
Esrever
I'll implement a function to reverse a list without using built-in methods.
Log me
I'll develop a function to print the number of arguments already printed along with new argument values.
Number conversion
I'll craft a function to convert numbers from base 10 to a specified base.
